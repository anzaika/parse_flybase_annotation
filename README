Library aims to parse typical flybase gene annotation text file.
Each string has 11 tab separated colums. Like this one:

  | unknown      | 585             |
  | mrna_id      | CG11023-RA      |
  | chromosome   | chr2L           |
  | strand       | +               |
  | mrna_start   | 7528            | \ -- with UTRs
  | mrna_stop    | 9491            | /
  | mrna_c_start | 7679            | \ -- without UTRs
  | mrna_c_stop  | 9276            | /
  | seg_count    | 3               |
  | seg_starts   | 7528,8228,8667, |
  | seg_stops    | 8116,8589,9491, |

There can be several records with the same mrna_id, which denotes
alternative splicing.

Library should return mrna and segment objects.

Blueprints:

mRNA:

* mrna_id     (String)
* gene_id     (Fixnum)
* strand      (String) '+' or '-'
* chromosome  (String)
* segment_ids (Array[Fixnum]) -- this field should contain segment_ids of segments
                                 that constitute the mRNA, in order of how they are
                                 arranged in the mRNA. Sorted from 5' to 3'.

segment:

* segment_id (Fixnum)
* strand     (String) '+' or '-'
* chromosome (String)
* mrnas      (Array[Fixum])
* start      (Fixnum)
* stop       (Fixnum)
* splicing   (String) 'const' or 'alt'
