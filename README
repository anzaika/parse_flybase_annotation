Library aims to parse typical flybase gene annotation text file.
Each string has 11 tab separates colums. Like this one:

  | unknown    | 585             |
  | gene_id    | CG11023-RA      |
  | chromosome | chr2L           |
  | strand     | +               |
  | mrna_start | 7528            |
  | mrna_stop  | 9491            |
  | unkwnown   | 7679            |
  | mrna_id    | 9276            |
  | seg_count  | 3               |
  | seg_starts | 7528,8228,8667, |
  | seg_stops  | 8116,8589,9491, |

There can be several records with the same mrna_id, which denotes
alternative splicing.

Library should return mrna and segment objects.

Blueprints:

mRNA:

* mrna_id       (Fixnum)
* strand        (String) '+' or '-'
* chromosome    (String)
* segment_ids   (Array[Fixnum]) -- this field should contain segment_ids of segments
                                   that constitute the mRNA, in order of how they are
                                   arranged in the mRNA. Sorted from 5' to 3'.

segment:

* segment_id (Fixnum)
* strand     (String) '+' or '-'
* chromosome (String)
* mrnas      (Array[Fixum])
* start      (Fixnum)
* stop       (Fixnum)
* splicing   (String) 'const' or 'alt'
